So tonight I gave a brief talk at the inaugural Brighton Raspberry Jam organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brightonpi">@BrightonPi</a> and hosted by the wonderful people of the <a href="http://www.buildbrighton.com/blog/">Brighton Hackspace</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/buildbrighton">@BuildBrighton</a>. Due to time constraints, I didn't have the time to prepare a slide deck for my talk, instead I just stood at the front, enthused about the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/whats-a-raspberry-jam/">Raspberry Jam</a> and <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired State</a>. I promised everyone I would post links to all the stuff I talked about. So, here it all is.

A big "Thank You" to everyone who came along tonight and politely listened to me enthuse and gesticulate like a mad man. Hopefully I wasn't too scary.
