The Friday following [my talk at BathCamp](http://neilcford.uk/bathcamp-hacking-dinosaurs.html), found me bright and early at Southampton Docks waiting to board a ferry to the Isle of Wight, to spend a few more days at [Blackgang Chine](http://www.blackgangchine.com/lands-of-imagination/restricted-area-5) working on their dinosaurs.

This was the fourth such trip and the format was pretty much unchanged from before. Event organizer [Dr Lucy Rogers](http://lucyrogers.com/), [James Macfarlane](http://www.ael.co.uk/), [Andy Stanford-Clark](http://stanford-clark.com/) and myself were to be on hand to assist the Blackgang staff with the projects they wanted to progress over the course of the three days. We would also be joined by some invited guests who would be working on anything that took their fancy, as long as it was Raspberry Pi related.

The weekend also included a trip to the Electric Woods at Robin Hill on the Saturday night, so that the team could start to think how the Pi and NodeRed could be used there to add extra dimensions to the audio and visual installations.

All in all it was a great weekend with much being achieved and I'm looking forward to returning again to continue the work.
