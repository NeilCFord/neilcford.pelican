Another Teachmeet Brighton, another Raspberry Pi presentation, this time provocativly called "Doing Shit with a Raspberry Pi". For those that couldn't be there, my presentation can be downloaded as a pdf from [here](/static/pdfs/TeachmeetBrighton_March2014.pdf).

Thanks to [Marc Scott](https://twitter.com/coding2learn) for the [inspiration](http://coding2learn.org/blog/2014/02/12/what-exactly-are-we-teaching-anyway/) for the talk's title.
