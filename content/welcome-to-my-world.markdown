<p>So once again I find myself starting a new blog. Given my past track record, I'm not sure how long this one will last before I carelessly abandon it, but I'm going to hopefully give it a fair crack of the whip.</p>
<p>What am I going to blog about? Stuff that interests me or I feel passionate about or just piques my interest. So that will include science fiction and fantasy books, role playing games, technology and gadgets at the very least and quite possibly a whole lot of other stuff too. One of the joys of having Attention Deficit Disorder is that what seems interesting this week, might be of absolutely no interest the next. Makes for a fun life.</p>
<p>I'm currently undecided if I'm going to use just one domain for my personal and professional web presences, so things may change a little around here as I get to grips with that, but on the whole I'm hoping to keep things nice an consistent.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have a little more configuration to do to make this place feel like home.<br /></p>
