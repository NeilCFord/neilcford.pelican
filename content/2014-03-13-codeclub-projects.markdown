Today [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) [announced](http://blog.codeclub.org.uk/2014/03/13/so-open-much-access-all-of-the-code-club-projects-are-online/) that they have opened up their Scratch, Python and HTML/CSS [projects](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/projects) to everyone.

This is awesome news. Now it means teachers who don't have a Code Club in their school can get access to the materials and use them in class to introduce their kids to [Getting Shit Done With A Computer](http://coding2learn.org/blog/2014/02/12/what-exactly-are-we-teaching-anyway/) that little bit easier.

So if you don't already have the materials, go and get them now!
