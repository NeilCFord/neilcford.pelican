Today I went to [Teachmeet Brighton](http://www.facebook.com/TeachMeetBrighton) held at City College Brighton to give a presentaion about the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) showcasing some of the cool things people have done with the Pi and hopefully providing some inspiration for teachers of the kinds of things they could try in their classrooms. Hopefully I succeeded a little in my aim.

The slide deck from my pesentation can be found on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/neilcford/teachmeet-brighton-presentation). There was an embedded video which can be found on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/I41ooQQ_RIw).

I will be giving the same presentation again in a couple of weeks at [Teachmeet Sussex](http://www.teachmeetsussex.com/p/next-teachmeet-sussex.html) though I may well mix things up a little as a lot of the same teachers may be in attendance and I dont want to bore them.
