Having not updated this blog for quite some time, the first post back is just a note to say that I have changed the engine behind the site from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

Why? Because I spend a lot of my time using [Python](https://python.org), in my work with both [CPD for Teachers](https://www.cpdforteachers.com/) and [FireTech Camp](http://firetechcamp.com/), and working with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/), so it made sense to you use python to generate this site rather than ruby.

The transition was relatively painless. I just installed Pelican on my laptop, copied the files that made up the content to a new folder, edited the frontmatter to match what Pelican expects, and generated the output. Then it was a case of pushing the generated files to my webserver. Job done!

Now to see if I can actually get around to blogging more regularly.
