In my initial post I mentioned book reviews. Well I'm finally going to get around to this, but they are going to be a little different from the norm. No longwinded dissection of a book, no elaborate scoring system,  just a paragraph or two saying why I liked the book and a link to Amazon so you can buy a copy if you like. Short, simple and to the point.

I may post them to Goodreads as well, I'm just not sure yet.
