So last Thursday night I gave a talk at the relaunch of [BathCamp](http://www.meetup.com/BathCamp/) organised by Paul Leader. The topic of my talk? How the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) were used to upgrade the animatronic dinosaurs of [Blackgang Chine](http://www.blackgangchine.com/lands-of-imagination/restricted-area-5) on the Isle of Wight. I covered the reasons for wanting to replace the electronics that the dinosaurs came with, why the Raspberry Pi and Node-RED, and the progress of the project.

My slides from the talk can be found on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/neilcford/hacking-dinosaurs-for-fun-and-profit).
